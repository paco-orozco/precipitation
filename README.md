#Precipitation

The purpose of this app is to experiment with the UI of my fourth rails App, *Rnnr*, to improve the Aesthetics of a simple Idea.

I will also implement geo-location so that the need for a form will not be necessary and the app will be more intuative.

Stack will include RoR, jQuery, Wunderground API, and my own boiler-plate for styling.
